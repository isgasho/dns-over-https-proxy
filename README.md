# DNS-over-HTTPS proxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wrouesnel/dns-over-https-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wrouesnel/dns-over-https-proxy) [![Godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/wrouesnel/dns-over-https-proxy?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/wrouesnel/dns-over-https-proxy)

An implementation of a forwarding DNS proxy for using Google's DNS-over-HTTPS
service with conventional applications.

Currently does no caching or particularly sensible parsing, and supports only
A and AAAA records (as no API to convert them to Go-DNS format is yet written,
and the Google API is still in flux).

## Usage
Just run it! Remember if you're behind a corporate proxy you will need to set your
`http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables to contact the Google DNS servers
through them. It might also be advisable use a local caching proxy in front of this
if it's going to be a daily driver.

By default it binds to port 53, so if you have a local resolver it will fail to
start. You can test it by binding to a high port and using dig like so:

```
dns-over-https-proxy -debug=true -address=127.0.0.1:8500 -log.level=debug
```

and then running dig will produce output similar to the below:
```
$ dig -p 8500 @127.0.0.1 google.com
; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-11ubuntu1.3-Ubuntu <<>> -p 8500 @127.0.0.1 google.com
